## other than与rather than的区别  
### （一）  
　　rather than是连词，前后两端所连的词性是一致的，通常译为“而不是”或“与其说是……不如说是”，有时可用短语介词instead of替代。例如：  
He was engaged in writing a letter rather than(= instead of) reading the newspaper.    他那时是在写信而不是看报纸。  
John ought to go rather than(= instead of) Jean.    应该去的是约翰，而不是吉恩。  
These shoes are comfortable rather than pretty.    这些鞋子谈不上漂亮，但穿起来倒很舒服。  
Evans is a historian rather than a writer.    埃文斯与其说是个作家，不如说是个史学家。   

other than有两种意思：一是用来表示否定意义，即“不同于（= different from)，非（= not)";二是用来表示排除意义，即“除了”，相当于except。例如：  
The truth is quite other than what you think.    事实真相和你们想的完全不一样。

### （二）  
other than' implies two or more choices that are equally important or that you feel neutral about. Let's say you could either go fishing or go swimming, and you don't have a preference: Other than going fishing, we could go swimming.  

'rather than' implies two or more choices with different levels of value or desirability. Let's say you like swimming more than fishing: Rather than going fishing, I would like to go swimming.  

### （三）  
other than 除了…；除…之外 (常用于否定结构中)

rather than 意为“而不是”、“而没有”,侧重客观上的差别,还可以表示“与其……,倒不如（或宁可）……”,侧重句子主语或说话人主观上的选择.句中 rather than 前后一般应为名词、代词、动名词、形容词、谓语动词、动词不定式、介词短语,甚至分句等.下面分别举例说明.

二、接代词

2.You should help me rather than I should help you.你应当帮我,而不是我应当帮你.  
使用 rather than 时,还应注意以下两点：  
1.rather than 很像并列连词.其前后都应是相互对应的词语,但接不定式时,常可省去不定式符号 to .  
2.rather than 也可分开使用,和 would 或 had 构成“ would / had rather … than ”结构,than 前后也是相互对等的结构.试比较：  
（ 1 ） She would rather have the small one than the large one.她宁愿要小的,也不愿要大的.  
（ 2 ） Tom would rather be liked than feared.汤姆宁愿受人爱戴,而不愿让人惧怕.  
（ 3 ） Wouldn't you rather be liked than feared?你不是宁愿受人爱戴,而不愿让人惧怕吗?  
但当 would rather 被用作谓语动词后接宾语从句时,从句中的谓语动词应为虚拟形式.例如：  
I'd rather you came tomorrow than today.我宁愿明天来,而不是今天来.
